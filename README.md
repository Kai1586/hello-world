# hello-world

Inspired by the game changing potential of technology underlying Bitcoin, encouraged through attending Bitcoin Brisbane & Blockchain and Brisbane Ethereum meetups and by the sentiments of https://github.com/bokkypoobah/QuitYourFuckingShittyJob- I took sabbatical from my long standing middle management gig within the Queensland government. It was July 2017 and I simply gave myself permission, time and space to be authentic, to get up to speed with where the world was heading and work on stuff that actually ignited my passion.

My journey started out in a rather accidental way. First task on my being authentic journey was to make progress with one of my bucket list items - to win a major international poker tournament. This one was going to be tricky because the Australian government had just recently banned the provision of online poker services to Australian citizens. Online poker tournaments was a practical way to get in volumes of experience competing for decent prize money in large player pools. Before the Australian government ban, I would record and play back online sessions with my amazing poker coach and we would spend hours dissecting hand histories and analysing my execution of various game strategies. I finally acheived that bucket list item by winning an event in the 2019 World Poker Tour Australia. But when COVID hit live poker competitions rapidly became something of a bygone era struggleing to come back to its

Many Australian online poker players (who were unable to relocate overseas) tried work arounds like VPN's and fake accounts but the IP blocking, geo blocking and censorship technology being deployed to prevent us from competing in our favourite game. As a work around to the online poker ban, I looked into the viability of playing anonymous online poker with Bitcoin. I had acquired my first piece of Bitcoin in mid 2016, back in the day when I didn't know a single person who owned any Bitcoin or even a single person knew what bitcoin was. 

To validate whether the idea of investing time to compete in online Bitcoin poker was a sound way to past time or if it was totaly nuts, I embarked on a quest to find and talk to someone who actually knew stuff about Bitcoin. A bit of google searching narrowed my pursuit down to one dude, a Brisbane local named Lucas Cullen. Lucas had been advising the Australian Senate on Bitcoin technology from as early as 2014, and advised Blockchain Australian of technical standards, he ran a local software development consultancy called Bitcoin Brisbane and led an Australian team to win the Deloitte/ConsenSys blockchain hackathon in New York in 2017. Low and behold, Lucas was also a poker player and in his spare time he was working on open source development of a blockchain based poker game https://github.com/bitcoinbrisbane/BitPoker. Bitpoker has sinced morphed in its thinking and we are currenlty working on a block52.io project to articulate how to build a domain specific blockchain where playing cards are programmatically built onto the blockchain which would enable a protocal for online poker applications that overcome the integrity issues currently experienced with centralised poker platforms being used today. 

It became apparent that this Lucas was a rather elusive individual seemingly always out of town at some exotic location, imparting his wisdom about blockchain technology. It took me a while to find Lucas, a born to be programer and uniquely cool dude with ripped jeans, a hoodie and a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) cap LOL. Recently been working on a gig with the Virtue Poker team at ConsenSys (when he's is not trying to stack me off all my chips at the local card room). 

In my pursuit to meet Lucas, I meet many amazing individuals along the way. The first standout was Eru Penkman, a passionate developer from ThoughtWorks. Eru is the loveliest guy who totally unravelled all of my misconceptions about computer geeks. Eru opened up my world to a whole community of people that are not only brilliant coders and software developers but also incredibly well rounded individuals who see disruptive technologies as a vehicle for making positive social change for all people in the world. 

The software company ThoughWorks also blow me away, with their innovative, collaborative and agile workplace culture that had social and economic justice at the heart of its software development. Through some of the free talks and information sessions held by ThoughtWorks, I started learning all sorts of disturbing stuff about digital rights and digital privacy, algorithmic justice, the misuse of personal data and the inelegant interface between sovereignty, law and technology. I stopped using public WiFis and started using VPNs and ToR browsers and transitioned over to end to end encryption for everything. 

It was Eru who encouraged me enter into the Aaron Swartz Day Brisbane Hackathon. I was very fortunate to partner up with Samuel Huang, a very clever backend developer and software engineer who recently immigrated to Australia from China to enable his passion to build solutions for human rights to internet access and digital privacy. We took down first place in the hackathon with our project that built and documented installation instructions for a free, anonymous, disposal, cloud based VPN that was accessible from within the Great Firewall of China. The downloadable client package configures a range of existing open source scripts that have the effect of rendering a wide range of digital censorship methods ineffective. It was a pretty awesome project because it enables encrypted internet access for personal use for people who’s digital rights are affected by censorship regimes.

The project went to soft launch in early 2018 through trusted community networks within China, and just in time for the implementation of Chinese government regulations that officially made it illegal for domestic service providers to provide VPN services to local Chinese citizens. Feedback from early adopters is that it is working. Open source collaboration for continuous improvement is welcomed via the Github repo at https://github.com/samuelhbne/vpn-launchpad. 

I got involved in a BeerDev Weekend helping a Startup called Brew2Venue. Participants learned how to start building a simple blockchain project. The project we worked on was to address supply chain issues that were effecting the growth and viability of the craft brew beer industry in Australia. The BeerDev was an excellent hands on learning opportunity that gave me a practical introduction into Solidity, creating an Ethereum genesis block and a conceptual framework for how the blockchain interacts with the rest of the stack. https://github.com/brew2venue/brisbanehack  Following BeerDev, I read from cover to cover Chris Dannen’s book "Introducing Ethereum and Solidity - Foundations of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Programming for Beginners" and I regularily attend Etheruem Engineering education sessions hosted by ConsenSys.

My technology journey cannot go without shinning acknowledgement to Katrina Donaghy, co-founder and now CEO of Civic Ledger, one of the very early adopter start ups in the blockchain space. Katrina is a very courages, resilient and forthright lady with this crazy curly hair. Katrina established the Brisbane Women in Blockchain meetup which provided a voice for inspirational narrative of those who are quietly chipping away at developing blockchain solutions that challenge traditional inefficient and ineffective ways of doing things like registeries, ledgers and supply chains. I was forunate to get to work at Civic Ledger for 6 months where I got practical hands on experience in agile software development and client/product owner management and got to be a contributing author to an Etheruem Improvemnt Proposal EIP for ERC1753 which defines standard for the issuance of governmt licensing and entitlement on the ethereum blockchain.

I then took some time out to be treated for a breast cancer diagnosis and I spent many weeks and months in and out of hospital and playing online Bitcoin poker. I then decided to undertake the training and licencing required to operate as a private investigator. I followed this up by being part of last student intake for Michael Bazzels Open Source Intellegence (OSINT) course and have since continued my learning and application of OSINT through participating in the National Missing Persons Hackathon 2020.

In 2020, during the begining of the COVID19 pandemic, I was working from home as a private investigator and this kinda morhped into a gig with a tech start called Amber founded by Aleks Svetski, an articulate thought leader in the Bitcoin space. Amber has an App that is basically a simple to use bitcoin exchange.  I I manage their fraud causes and oversee the anti money laundering compliance and general security and risk management aspect of scaling the app to an overseas market. It can be realy ironic at times working at the interface of the legacy banking system and the new monetary operating system bitcoin. Its really cool working in a company where you can work with team members from anywhere in the world with pretty much your laptop and internet connection. 

I am keen to collaborate with like minded others to build innovative and disruptive technology solutions for a digital future that is accessible, fair, vibrant and innovative. I am passionate about social justice, human rights, environmental protection, economic participation and digital rights and inclusion outcomes. I regularly Tweet things related to digital rights, blockchain technology, cybersecurity, poker and cryptocurrencies @Yippiebeans and I can be found on my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/kai15/.
