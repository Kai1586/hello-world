# hello-world

Inspired by the game changing potential of blockchain technology that I had learned about through attending Bitcoin Brisbane & Blockchain and Brisbane Ethereum meetups and by the sentiments of https://github.com/bokkypoobah/QuitYourFuckingShittyJob- I walked out of my shitty regressive day job of 22 years with the Queensland government. It was July 2017 and I simply gave myself permission, time and space to be authentic, to get up to speed with where the world was heading and work on stuff that actually ignited my passion and made a difference.

My blockchain journey started out in a rather accidental way. First task on my being authentic journey was to progress one of my bucket list items - to win a major international poker tournament. To my horror, the Australian government had violated my digital freedom, by banning the provision of online poker services to Australian citizens. Online poker tournaments was a practical way to get in volumes of experience competing for decent prizes in large player pools against professional poker players. Before the government ban, I would play back online sessions with my amazing poker coach and we would spend hours dissecting hand histories and analysing my execution of various game strategies. 

As a work around to the online poker ban, I looked into the viability of playing anonymous online poker with Bitcoin. I had acquired my first piece of Bitcoin in mid 2016, back in the day when I didn't know a single person in my networks who owned any bitcoin or even a single person knew what bitcoin was. 

To validate whether the idea of investing time to play online Bitcoin poker was totally crazy or not, I embarked on a quest to meet someone who actually knew stuff about bitcoin. A bit of cyber searching narrowed my pursuit down to one dude, Lucus Cullen. Lucus had been advising the Australian Senate on Bitcoin technology from as early as 2014, and had been advising Blockchain Australian of technical standards, he ran a local software development consultancy called Bitcoin Brisbane and led the team that won the Deloitte/Consensus blockchain hackathon in New York in 2017. Low and behold, Lucus was also a poker player and in his spare time he was working on open source development of a blockchain based poker game https://github.com/bitcoinbrisbane/BitPoker. I read the BitPoker repo several times, appreciating its ingenuity and realising that the rort free online poker platform I was looking for to restore and revolutionise online poker was a decentralised blockchain system and that was yet to be developed.

Lucus is a rather elusive individual seemingly always out of town at some exotic location to impart his knowledge about blockchain technology. It took me a while to find Lucus, a born to be programer and uniquely cool dude with ripped jeans and a hoodie who is now working on his dream gig on the Virtue Poker team (when he is not trying to bluff me of all my chips at the local card room). I am a self appointed Beta tester of CoinPoker which has made an impressive debut and it would be wonderful for the poker ecosystem if the two projects could collaborate together especially with respect to universal adoption of the CHP token.  

In my pursuit to meet Lucus, I meet many amazing individuals along the way. The first standout was Eru Penkman, a passionate developer from Thoughtworks. Eru is the loveliest guy who totally unravelled all of my misconceptions about computer geeks. Eru opened up my world to a whole community of people that are not only brilliant coders and software developers but also incredibly well rounded individuals who see disruptive technologies as a vehicle for making positive change for all people in the world. 

The software company Thoughworks also blow me away, with their innovative, collaborative and agile workplace culture that had social and economic justice at the heart of its software development. Through some of the free talks and information sessions held by Thoughtworks, I started learning all sorts of disturbing facts about digital rights and digital privacy, algorithmic justice, the misuse of personal data and the inelegant interface between sovereignty, law and technology. I stopped using public WiFis and started using VPNs and ToR browsers and transitioned over to encrypted email and messaging services. 

It was Eru who encouraged me enter into the Aaron Swartz Day Brisbane Hackathon. I was very fortunate to partner up with Samuel Huang, a very clever backend developer and software engineer who recently immigrated to Australia from China to enable his passion to build solutions for human rights to internet access and digital privacy. We took down first place in the hackathon with our project that built and documented installation instructions for a free, anonymous, disposal, cloud based VPN that was accessible from within the Great Firewall of China. The downloadable client package configures a range of existing open source scripts that have the effect of rendering a wide range of digital censorship methods ineffective. It was a pretty awesome project because it enables encrypted internet access for personal use for people who’s digital rights are affected by censorship regimes.

The project went to soft launch in early 2018 through trusted community networks within China, and just in time for the implementation of Chinese government regulations that officially made it illegal for domestic service providers to provide VPN services to local Chinese citizens. Feedback from early adopters is that it is working well for iOS systems connecting to the AWS cloud but users relying on the Windows operating systems and the MS Azure cloud are not having the best user experience. Open source collaboration for continuous improvement is welcomed via the Github repo at https://github.com/samuelhbne/vpn-launchpad.

Another exciting layer of my blockchain journey was meeting Hayden Otto who brought my hobby of crypto currency trading to a new level of understanding and professionalism. The crypto currency and ICO space went hyper ballistic in 2017, and through Hayden’s mentoring I was able to find a balance way to navigate the space through the FUD and FOMO and the hype. My ultimate goal is to accumulate crypto assets, participate in the crypto economy ecosystem and invest in software development projects that I believe will be future game changers. I actively support CryptoStrategies fortnightly meetups by supporting new members with friendly education and guidance through their own crypto journeys.

Tom Miller, a gun developer at Consensus was another significant influencer in my blockchain journey. Tom is a very likeable, community orientated sorta guy who literally lives in a cave and taught himself to code. He made me believe that with dedication and hard work that I too could learn to code. I have had to start right from the beginning with completing computer science 101. My rate of self learning to code may be pacing significantly slower than a young dude who lives in a cave but I figure that even if I grasp some basic understanding of what is possible with coding, that I will be doing alright for a great grandmother who way back in another era completed her Masters of Science Degree using a typewriter.

I was also privileged to be involved in BeerDev for a start up based out of Fishburner’s called Brew2Venue. Participants learned how to start building a simple blockchain project. The project we worked on was to address supply chain issues that were effecting the growth and viability of the craft brew beer industry in Australia. The BeerDev was an excellent hands on learning opportunity that gave me a practical introduction into Solidity, creating an Ethereum genesis block and a conceptual framework for how the blockchain interacts with the rest of the stack. https://github.com/brew2venue/brisbanehack  Following BeerDev, I read from cover to cover Chris Dannen’s book "Introducing Ethereum and Solidity - Foundations of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Programming for Beginners" and immediately could see the enormity of the Ethereum platform and smart contract technology. 

My blockchain journey cannot go without shinning acknowledgement to Katrina Donaghy, co-founder of Civic Ledger, one of the early adopter start ups in the blockchain space. Katrina is a very courages, resilient and forthright lady with this crazy curly hair. Katrina established the Brisbane Women in Blockchain meetup which provides a voice for a important and inspirational narrative of the women who are quietly chipping away at developing blockchain solutions and business delivery to make the world a better place.

I am keen to collaborate with like minded others to build blockchain and other disruptive technology solutions for a digital future that is accessible, fair, vibrant and innovative. I am passionate about social justice, human rights, environmental protection, economic participation and digital inclusion outcomes.
